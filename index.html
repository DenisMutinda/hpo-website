                                Until recently, Logistics, Procurement and Supply Chain (LPS) was only seen as a necessity. In fact, in many developing economies, businesses the profession is still being treated as a ‘back-office’ function. However, not much has been done to explore and address challenges facing businesses and government successes in these economies due to poor or low LPS expertise.

                                                    House of Procurement’s intelligent energy storage and management system gives facility managers a new level of control over both the cost and reliability of electrical power.

                                                    Onsite intelligent energy storage enables organizations to “level the load” by taking advantage of incentive electricity rates, while avoiding high demand charges and time-of-use fees. The ability to generate electricity on demand also keeps mission-critical systems running during power outages. Onsite storage makes it easier to add onsite generation from renewable and non-renewable by making it possible to accommodate both peak load and peak production.

                                                    No facility is too large or too small to benefit from this solution. And with the many benefits afforded by an intelligent energy storage and management system, the investment usually pays for itself relatively quickly based on consumption. 
                                                    The ultimate future of smart buildings and campuses is a microgrid that consumes “net zero” energy from the grid, and has a minimal or zero carbon footprint.

                                                    Microgrids and VPPs benefit considerably from the ability to “level the load” by alternately storing and generating energy as needed. Diesel generators no longer need to power up and down to regulate load, conserving both fuel and wear and tear. And every Watt of power generated whenever the sun shines and the wind blows can be put to use independently of the current demand.
                                                </p>
                                                <p class="font-italic mb-0 text-muted">
                                                    When tied to the grid, intelligent energy storage enables organizations to take full advantage of incentive electricity rates, while avoiding high demand charges and time-of-use fees. And having sufficient capacity makes it possible to keep mission-critical systems running during grid disturbances and brief outages without firing up any generators.
                                                    In an independent microgrid or VPP, intelligent energy storage and management makes optimal use of all sources of generation. Intermittent solar and wind generation can become the “primary” sources of power, with diesel generators being used only when necessary. The result is an energy ecosystem that is more dependable, more stable and more affordable.

                                                    Until the last few years East Africa has been a sleepy backwater for the upstream industry, but the discovery of significant quantities of oil in Uganda in 2006 has ushered in a bonanza. Onshore oil discoveries in Uganda have been followed by discoveries in Kenya. Offshore we have seen world-class discoveries of gas in Tanzania and Mozambique. Now every potential hydrocarbon basin across East Africa is the subject of intensive interest.

                                                    We have also seen an influx of majors, super-majors and big independents. Indeed so rapid has the industry‟s progress been that this slim volume has been through a number of re-writes before it even reached the public domain.

                                                    It is important to bear in mind that East Africa remains one of the world‟s poorest, least developed regions. Many of its inhabitants live on less than a dollar a day. The development of oil and gas will provide a major stimulus to the local economies and will require extensive upgrading of the existing infrastructure. Governments across the region are already looking at how to harness the power of the industry to benefit their people. At the same time oil and gas companies are also focusing their efforts on the development of local content and local capacity. The arrival of the international oil and gas industry offers hope of a better life for millions.

                                                    Expectations across the region are high, but there is still a long and (perhaps) winding road to follow before upstream oil and gas exploitation starts to deliver results in terms of higher living standards and increased tax revenues for governments.

                                                    By the end of 2014, there were more mobile devices in use than people on Earth. And by 2018 there will be over 10 billion mobile-connected devices — nearly 1.4 devices for every one of the world’s 7.6 billion people — with global mobile data traffic expected to increase 11-fold. 1 Such explosive growth of cellular telecommunication subscriptions and traffic is driving demand for additional telecom towers and expanded networks all across the globe, especially in developing and emerging countries.

                                                    The World Bank estimates that over 75% of the world’s population now uses a cell phone,2 and Analysys Mason, a telecommunications research firm, predicts that 3 out of 4 base stations will be deployed in emerging markets by 2017. As cellular networks expand their global coverage, telecom towers are increasingly located in regions with an unreliable or nonexistent power grid. Towers might be sited in remote locations (mountaintops, forests and jungles, deserts) where the grid does not reach, or in areas with notoriously unstable grid supplies of electricity. As a result, telecom tower companies (towercos) as well as telcos in these regions depend on diesel generators as their primary source of power.

                                                    However, in recent years the costs associated with diesel generation have increased significantly. Not only has the price of diesel almost doubled in the past decade, but refueling and maintaining generators (diesel generators frequently break down) in remote sites is expensive. Diesel theft is also a problem that adds to the expense. The costs associated with running diesel generators for long hours every day at telecom tower sites can be more than 20% of the total revenue of such companies.

                                                    Based on the above, power supply using renewable energy such as solar power is expected to become the next alternative to grid as well as diesel dependency. House of Procurement solutions will enable efficient management of mixed power such as grid and solar, including but not limited to lithium ion batteries offering high-speed charging and longer battery life, and prediction of solar power generation and energy consumption by House of procurements state-of-the-art data analytics.
