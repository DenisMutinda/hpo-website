              <p class="text-center font-weight-bold">Supply Chain Strategy Development</p>
              <p>
                The supply chain is central to business efficiency and performance. Performance is increased when supply chain costs are monitored, controlled and optimized end to end: purchasing is optimized (buying at the best price), procurement is streamlined to reduce procurement cycles and idle stock, and delivery of services to the final customer is improved. 
              </p>
              <p>House of Procurement assists its clients in the development and implementation of Supply Chain Strategy using a three-step approach:
                <ul>
                  <li>Assessment and root cause analysis;</li>
                  <li>Stategy development and option assessment;</li>
                  <li>Implementation and delivery.</li>
                </ul>
              </p>
              <p>
                At the end of the assessment phase a clear understanding of the supply chain is reached; key challenges and the required changes and improvements are identified. A Strategic Roadmap is built to address company challenges and to achieve higher performance through the implementation of optimized and improved supply chain functions and operations. Implementation is key and delivering the promises of the Strategic Roadmap can only be achieved with an efficient and effective implementation and execution plan and team. House of Procurement supports its clients by providing planning and monitoring consulting services and resources as well as hands-on consultants to address specific operational areas. House of Procurement expertise covers the full range of supply chain components (logistics infrastructure, supply Chain processes, conversion, inventory management, human resources and information systems).
